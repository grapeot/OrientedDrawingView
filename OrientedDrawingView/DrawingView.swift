/**
    Represents a single drawing action in a specific configuration.

    This allows you to create an "action" for drawing a line at the top when you were rotated to landscape and the drawing view was 320x568, then rotate to upside down portrait, size down the drawing view to 10x10, draw a line 3/4 of the way down from the new top, rotate to portrait and 320x320, and both lines will stretch perfectly to the same exact proportions they had relative to the drawing view in each of their source orientations & sizes.

    How? It stores a normalized path, meaning every point on it has an x and y value between 0 and 1. It also stores the orientation and DrawingView.bounds.size in which it was created (sourceOrientation and sourceBounds). As you add more subpaths to the path, it normalizes them based on sourceBounds. When it comes time to draw the path in a new configuration, it rotates the point about (0.5, 0.5) (ALWAYS the center after we've normalized the points :) by (newOrientation - sourceOrientation) degrees (see extension UIDeviceOrientation above) and then scales it to the new DrawingView bounds.
